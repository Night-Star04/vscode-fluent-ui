Enhance your Visual Studio Code experience with a modern, Fluent UI-inspired theme.

VS Code Fluent UI is a theme extension that brings the sleek aesthetics of Microsoft's Fluent UI
design to Visual Studio Code. It offers features like blurred backgrounds, compact mode, and
customizable color schemes to provide a refined coding environment.

Inspired by and based on the awesome concept designs by
[u/zeealeidahmad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/orbgzl/visual_studio_vs_code_and_github_desktop_with/).

> official support for such modifications, **use it at your own risk**.

## Configuration Options

The extension provides several settings to customize the theme to your liking. You can adjust the
theme's appearance, wallpaper background, accent colors, and more.

Details on the available settings can be found in the [Settings](/STEEING.md) page.

### Default settings

```json
{
    // Applies slight less padding around some of the elements.
    // The difference is subtle but can help those with limited space.
    "fluentui.compact": false,
    // Enable background image
    "fluentui.enableWallpaper": false,
    // Path to image. By default, it will use the default Windows 11 wallpaper for the Windows light theme.
    "fluentui.wallpaperPath": "C:\\Windows\\Web\\Wallpaper\\Windows\\img0.jpg",
    // Accent color. Only HEX values are supported.
    "fluentui.accent": "#005fb8",
    // Background color for dark mode. Only HEX values are supported.
    "fluentui.darkBackground": "#202020",
    // Background color for light mode. Only HEX values are supported.
    "fluentui.lightBackground": "#ffffff"
}
```

## FAQ

This section only covers the most common issues. If you encounter any other problems, please check
the [Troubleshooting](/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page or open an new issue on the github.

1. **Why does the corrupt installation warning appear?**

    This is normal, don't worry. This is expected behavior and is necessary for the extension to
    work.

    When you install the extension, extensions modify the workbench html file to apply the theme.
    Visual Studio Code sees the installation as corrupt because the file has been modified.

2. **Why can’t I use the default theme’s visual studio code normally after uninstalling it?**

    This is possible, but the chances are slim.

    If you encounter this issue, please follow the steps below to fix it. Please refer to the
    [uninstallation](/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#uninstallation) section for further instructions.

3. **Can I use this with other extensions?**

    Yes, you can use this theme with other extensions. However, some extensions may not be
    compatible with this theme.

    If you encounter any issues, please disable the theme and check if the problem persists. If it
    does, the issue is likely caused by the extension. Please open an new issue on the github.

### Standard font

The workbench is set to use Segoe UI Variable (the new standard font for Windows 11). I highly
recommend downloading and installing it. If you don't, the theme will fallback to the default font.
